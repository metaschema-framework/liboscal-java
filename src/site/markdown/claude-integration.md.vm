# Claude Code Integration

${project.name} includes configuration for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Anthropic's agentic coding tool. This integration enables AI-assisted development with context-aware guidance specific to OSCAL and this library.

## Overview

Claude Code can assist with:

- Understanding the OSCAL data model and library architecture
- Writing code that uses ${project.name} APIs
- Debugging issues with OSCAL document processing
- Implementing profile resolution and validation workflows
- Following project coding conventions and best practices

## Project Configuration

This repository includes a `.claude/` directory with project-specific configuration:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Project instructions and conventions that Claude follows
- **settings.json** - Tool permissions and project settings

The configuration provides Claude with:

- Build and test commands specific to this project
- Code style and architecture guidelines
- Git workflow requirements (worktrees, PR process)
- Links to relevant documentation

## Claude Plugins

Enhanced capabilities are available through [Claude plugins](https://github.com/metaschema-framework/claude-plugins/tree/main) from the metaschema-framework organization:

### OSCAL Plugin

The `oscal` plugin provides OSCAL-specific skills:

| Skill | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `oscal:oscal-basics` | OSCAL document structure, models, and concepts |

### Metaschema Plugin

The `metaschema` plugin provides Metaschema knowledge:

| Skill | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `metaschema:metaschema-basics` | Introduction to Metaschema concepts |
| `metaschema:metaschema-module-authoring` | Creating and modifying Metaschema modules |
| `metaschema:metaschema-constraints-authoring` | Writing validation constraints |
| `metaschema:metapath-expressions` | Metapath query language syntax |

### Metaschema Tools Plugin

The `metaschema-tools` plugin provides CLI and library guidance:

| Skill | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `metaschema-tools:metaschema-java-library` | Java library interfaces and patterns |
| `metaschema-tools:using-metaschema-java` | CLI commands for validation and conversion |

### OSCAL Tools Plugin

The `oscal-tools` plugin provides CLI guidance:

| Skill | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `oscal-tools:using-oscal-cli` | OSCAL CLI commands and workflows |

## Installing Plugins

To install metaschema-framework plugins, use the Claude Code settings or install via command line:

```bash
# Install individual plugins
claude plugins:install metaschema-framework/oscal
claude plugins:install metaschema-framework/metaschema
claude plugins:install metaschema-framework/metaschema-tools
claude plugins:install metaschema-framework/oscal-tools
```

## Example Workflows

### Understanding the Library

Ask Claude to explain library concepts:

```
"Explain how OscalBindingContext works and when I would use it"
"What's the difference between reading OSCAL as XML vs JSON?"
"How does profile resolution work in this library?"
```

### Writing Code

Ask Claude to help write code:

```
"Write code to load an OSCAL catalog from a JSON file"
"Create a method that validates an SSP against its imported profile"
"Show me how to programmatically create a component definition"
```

### Debugging

Ask Claude to help debug issues:

```
"This profile resolution is failing with [error]. What's wrong?"
"Why am I getting a validation error on this control?"
"Help me understand this Metapath constraint violation"
```

### Following Best Practices

Ask Claude about conventions:

```
"What's the correct way to handle null values in this library?"
"How should I structure tests for OSCAL document processing?"
"What naming conventions does this project use?"
```

## Development Workflow Integration

Claude Code integrates with the development workflow defined in CLAUDE.md:

1. **Git Worktrees** - Claude will guide you to use worktrees for feature development
2. **PR Process** - Claude knows to push to your fork and target the develop branch
3. **Testing** - Claude will run tests before suggesting code is complete
4. **Code Style** - Claude applies the project's formatting and style conventions
